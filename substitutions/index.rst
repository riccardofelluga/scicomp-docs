Substitutions
=============

This is a list of programmable substitutions in scicomp-docs.  You can
find the substitution definitions in the ``substitutions/`` directory,
and substitutions happen with
https://github.com/NordicHPC/sphinx_ext_substitution .

This page isn't intended for end-users, but there is nothing wrong
with checking this out.
